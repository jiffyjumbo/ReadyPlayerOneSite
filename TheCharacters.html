She is named after Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt. </div>

Aech is Wade's best friend , alhough the two didn't meet in-person until much later, Wade claims that they've always shared a great connection. In the beginning, it is clear that Wade and Aech shared many interests — movies, musics, videos games, and the hunt for Halliday's egg.  Their shared quest for Halliday's egg brought about friendly competition. Aech and Wade would spend their time together discussing pop culture, Almanac findings, the hunt, and girls.  He also attended OASIS public school, at OPS #1172.  In the real world Aech is a heavy-set African-American girl named Helen Harris. Helen uses a Caucasian Male appearance and voice for her OASIS avatar in order to be more easily respected by her peers. </div>

In contrast to Toshiro Yoshiaki, whom Akihide sees as a brother figure but is cold and untrusting of others, Akihide is more friendly to other gunters (namely those in the High Five) and connects with Wade Watts on a better level than Daito did. He reaches out to Parzival to inform him of Daito's digital and physical death at the hands of IOI.  </div>

He is described as having blonde hair and a hawkish nose. He orders the death of Daito and is tried for it at the end of the book. Sorrento also tried to kill Wade by detonating a bomb under his aunt's trailer in the stacks, killing everyone in that stack including Mrs. Gilmore, an elderly woman who was Wade's friend. Though he works for IOI, it is revealed that Sorrento took the job only for the opportunity to destroy the entire Oasis. </div>
